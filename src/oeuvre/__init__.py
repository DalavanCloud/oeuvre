"""The ``oeuvre`` library provides an interface to testing corpora.

When testing libraries and tooling (e.g., linters, style checkers, etc.) it is
useful and important to have a collection of code examples, along with
metadata, to test against. This collection of examples can be called either a
corpora (the plural of corpus) or oeuvre.

This library aims to make using corpora in tests easier.

See http://oeuvre.pycqa.org for documentation.
